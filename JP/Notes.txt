- At the time of this writing, the cutting room floor wiki doesn't have a page for this game. Here is some stuff that could go on its page if one wanted to make it.
	- There is an unused bone crunching sound found at $838000. According to pre-release materials, this was meant to be used when Grant is eated by the T-Rex, but was removed because Nintendo thought it sounded too realistic.
	- There are several unused outdoor textboxes, several of which contain text that only shows up in interior areas. Perhaps this is evidence that the interior sections were not in first person at one point like the NES version?

- The first person 3D rendering makes clever use of mode 7. Basically, each mode 7 tile is a single color and by placing them on the mode 7 tilemap, they represent the individual pixels of the image.
The game basically plots pixels onto the screen this way. It's a bit slow, but this was done without any chips and before Wolfenstein 3D was released on the SNES. Also, the programmers used up 5 entire ROM banks just for unrolled loop code to pull this off.

- This game makes use of Dolby Surround sound. What this means is that the game sends position data to the SPC700 when telling it to play sounds. I didn't look too deep into it, but I assume this affects the panning and the volume of the sounds.

- Going into a dark room without picking up the battery in the current building sets your damage taken variable to 0200, even though a value of 0100 is enough to kill grant. Perhaps the programmers wanted to make extra sure that you'd die in this situation?

- This game is capable of loading new music to the SPC700 without pausing. The music will fade out stop playing when this happens.

- This game makes use of the SNES mouse in the interior sections. It's not much of a good showcase for it though, since you can't look up/down and the amount of input lag when turning means that a regular controller gives you the exact same level of precision the mouse would give.

- The text boxes make use of pseduo hi-res mode in order to make them transparent. If you've ever played this game in ZSNES, ZSNES doesn't emulate this properly. This is why the text boxes are opaque if this game is played in ZSNES.

- The computer terminals have a cool touch where it generates one of 8 fractal patterns on the monitor. These patterns do seem to be procedurally generated, although I didn't investigate the code that did so.

- The two elevator music songs are done using a very large sample as the music. They'd probably be the easiest songs for the SMW music porters to port to SMW (althout good luck getting it past the music moderators if you try to sumbit such a port. XD)
